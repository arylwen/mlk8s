      "The phrase \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!\" is an example of a literary allusion to the historical events leading to the construction of the Panama Canal, specifically, the efforts of the visionary Spanish engineer Hernán Pérez de la Guera during the 18th century. The phrase is used by the protagonist in the novel \"The Power of Darkness,\" a tale set in post-apocalyptic, technologically advanced Europe. The narrator remarks that by engineering the canal, Hernán \"conquered the world with a plan, a man, a plan, a canal and a bayonet.\"<|endoftext|>\n"
