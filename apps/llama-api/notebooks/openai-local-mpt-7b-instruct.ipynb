      "One futuristic device that revolutionizes space travel is the hyperloop. The concept was proposed by Elon Musk, and it uses a pod of cargo and people to create a vacuum tube through a small mountain range. By creating a vacuum tube, the pods will use rocket thrusters to propel through the tube. This concept means that space travel could be much faster in the future by drastically cutting off travel time to get to outer space.<|endoftext|>#<|endoftext|>---\n",
