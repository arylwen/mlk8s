# useful apps

Most probably, everything in this repository could be handled with *vi*. Below are a handful of productivity tools I hope could help along the way.

## webapp manager
OneNote does not have a Linux client. Webapp manager wraps OneNote web interface in an application so you could add it to the dock.

## set terminal title
I found it useful to label different terminal tabs with their main function, e.g. LA-BLD, to indicate that is the window where the llama-api container image is built.
