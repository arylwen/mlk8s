#Useful apps

## Webapp manager
OneNote does not have a Linux client. Webapp manager wraps OneNote web interface in an application so you could add it to the dock.

## Set terminal title
I found it useful to label different terminal tabs with their main function, e.g. LA-BLD, to indicate that is the window where the llama-api docker image is built.
