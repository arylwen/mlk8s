# k8s node setup

A k8s cluster is composed of nodes. A node is a computer. I recommend i7 nodes with 32G of ram, however i5 with 16G of ram might work depending on the applications.

## k8s node setup steps:
1. [hardware setup](/docs/node-setup/hardware.md)
2. [operating system](/docs/node-setup/os.md)
3. [ssh](/docs/node-setup/ssh.md)
4. [xrdp](/docs/node-setup/xrdp.md)
3. [microk8s](/docs/node-setup/microk8s/microk8s-node.md)
